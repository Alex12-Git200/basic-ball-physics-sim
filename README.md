This is a readme for my first github projecct. I am currently learning pygame. I made a basic physics ball simulator. The code is def not clean, good luck looking through it.
The project contains some basic gravity, and collisions, also friction and velocity.

Controls:

P - Pause
F - Slow motion
Mouse click - teleport the ball there,and setting all velocities back to 0.
On/Off Switch - when it is on, when the ball gets teleported where the mouse click is, it keeps the x velocity it had before. 



Designed for 1080p resolution.
